Runtime and infrastructure repository for the MoiraWeave self-hosted AI
workload and agent operations platform.

## Scope

This repository owns platform runtime capabilities, not customer business logic.

### Included

- `services/`: API gateway, worker, shared runtime package, and step SDK
- `infra/`: Helm, Kubernetes, kind, and Terraform assets
- `monitoring/`: observability assets and dashboards
- `tests/`: integration and platform-level validation

### Excluded

- customer workload manifests
- customer agent/model internals
- customer environment overlays and secrets
- step-specific model services in the base runtime compose profile

MoiraWeave manages the control plane around agents: deployment, sessions,
messages, runs, events, cancellation, health, and artifacts. Agent runtimes such
as Hermes, OpenClaw, or LangGraph keep their own reasoning loop, memory, tools,
and configuration semantics.

## For platform users

You usually do not need to clone this repository directly.

Use the CLI instead:

1. `uv tool install moiraweave-cli`
2. `moira init`
3. Author `workload.yaml` manifests in `.moiraweave/workloads/`
4. Deploy local or Kubernetes workloads with `moira deploy local|k8s`

## Local development

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-packages
make ci
```

## CI/CD summary

- `ci.yml`: lint, typecheck, tests, image build and security scan
- `publish.yml`: publishes shared Python packages on release
- `release.yml`: automated release PR/versioning via Release Please

## Repository model

`docker-compose.yml` is intentionally generic. Workload-specific runtimes should be configured in the user workspace, not embedded in core.
