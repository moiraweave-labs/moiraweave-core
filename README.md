Runtime and infrastructure repository for the MoiraWeave platform.

## Scope

This repository owns platform runtime capabilities, not customer business logic.

### Included

- `services/`: API gateway, worker, shared runtime package, and step SDK
- `infra/`: Helm, Kubernetes, kind, and Terraform assets
- `monitoring/`: observability assets and dashboards
- `tests/`: integration and platform-level validation

### Excluded

- customer pipelines
- customer custom steps
- customer environment overlays and secrets
- step-specific model services in the base runtime compose profile

## For platform users

You usually do not need to clone this repository directly.

Use the CLI instead:

1. `uv tool install moiraweave-cli`
2. `moira project init`
3. Author pipelines and steps in your workspace

## Local development

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-packages
make ci
```

## CI/CD summary

- `ci.yml`: lint, typecheck, tests, image build and security scan
- `publish.yml`: publishes shared Python packages on release
- `release.yml`: automated release PR/versioning via Release Please

## Repository model

`docker-compose.yml` is intentionally generic. Step-specific runtime dependencies should be configured in the user workspace, not embedded in core.
